### Building

Snap.svg uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to build

* Open the terminal from the Snap.svg directory

        cd Snap.svg

* Install its command line interface (CLI) globally

        npm install -g grunt-cli

_*You might need to use `sudo npm`, depending on your configuration._

* Install dependencies with npm

        npm install

_*Snap.svg uses Grunt 0.4.0. You might want to [read](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) more on their website if you havenâ€™t upgraded since a lot has changed._

* Type `grunt` in the command line to build the files.
* The results will be built into the release folder.
* Alternatively type `grunt watch` to have the build run automatically when you make changes to source files.
