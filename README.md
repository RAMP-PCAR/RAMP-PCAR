# Reusable, Accessible, Mapping Platform (RAMP) 

This repo is obsolete and no longer maintained. Please visit [RAMP4-PCAR4](https://github.com/ramp4-pcar4/ramp4-pcar4) for the latest incarnation of the project.

## What is the RAMP?

* A collaborative open source project led by [Environment Canada](http://ec.gc.ca/).
* RAMP provides the ability to rapidly deploy a theme based Web Mapping application, or to support the implementation of a dynamic Web Mapping viewer.
* Built off of the ESRI JavaScript API, but strives for platform neutrality.
